Iris Flower Clustering using K-Means

This project applies **K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Machine Learning)** to group Iris flowers into 3 clusters based on four features:

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

The goal is to see how well K-Means can naturally form clusters matching the three species.

Project Overview
This project includes:
- Loading the Iris dataset  
- Preprocessing and scaling  
- Applying K-Means algorithm  
- Visualizing clusters  
- Comparing clusters with real species labels  

📁 Files
- **main.ipynb** – Full implementation  
- **statement.md** – Problem statement & scope  
- **images/** – Diagrams & plots

How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

3. Open **main.ipynb** in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
4. Run all cells  

📊 Results
- K-Means formed **3 clusters**  
- Setosa cluster is almost perfectly separated  
- Versicolor & Virginica clusters overlap (as expected)
