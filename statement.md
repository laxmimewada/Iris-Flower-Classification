# Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to group Iris flowers into clusters based on their physical measurements using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The project explores how well unsupervised learning can identify natural groupings in the Iris dataset without using species labels.

# Scope
- Load and preprocess the Iris dataset  
- Scale feature values  
- Apply K-Means clustering  
- Visualize clusters  
- Compare generated clusters with actual species  
- Interpret how well the clustering matches reality  

# Target Users
- Students learning Machine Learning  
- Beginners exploring unsupervised algorithms  
- Researchers analyzing clustering behavior on structured datasets  

# High-Level Features
- Data preprocessing  
- K-Means model creation  
- Elbow method   
- Cluster visualization  
- Comparison with actual species labels
